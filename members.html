        <p>Hello my name is Ferdinand.
            I come from the Northern part of Kenya which is really dry.
             This made me think about environment conservation since water and other survival resources were scarce in my home area.
              I came up with ideas and involved my 3 friends. 
              We formed a website and so far we have held 4 events and are still looking forward to holding more so we can come with enough funds to conserve the environment.
            I am the president of Tech for Environment Conservation</p>

        <p>Hey people, my name is Meshack.
            I come from a very arid place in the Eastern side of Kenya.
            I met Ferdinand in Moringa School where we became friends.
            In one of the conferences I attended with him, we came to know about technology for impact.
            He came up with the environment idea and I was thrilled since it was something I had been pondering about.
            Currently I serve as the secretary general of the foundation.
            We are hoping to grow and reach as many people as we can by 2030.

        <p>Hi guys, I am Ivy.
            I have always been interested in tree planting since the days of the late Wangari Maathai.
            I come from the Coast Region of Kenya. I was saddened by the fact that coconut trees are almost becoming extinct.
            I made it my personal initiative to always plant a tree wherever I went, but after some time it became devastating since the trees were not taken care of and most dried.
            I later enrolled to Moringa School where I joined hands with my current partners who we shared similar passion for environment conservation.
            Tech for Environment Conservation was born and I immediately got on board.Techonology is a powerful tool in environmental conservation awareness.
            Currently I am the secretary of the group.

        <p>Hello wonderful people, I am Gideon.
            I am from the Western part of Kenya. Joining Tech for Environment Conservation was by chance really.
            I met the team when I was researching a real life scenario project to showcase my skills since I had just graduated from Moringa School.
            I am mainly the IT person in the group and I have come to value environment conservation.
            I mainly design flyers and brochures for our events and keep track of our social media.Through technology it is easy to reach many people at once.
            I also serve as the treasurer.
